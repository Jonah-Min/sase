    <h3>Undergraduate Mentorship</h3>
    <p>
      Piloted during the Fall 2014 semester, our program is centered
      on building a strong community between members. This one semester program
      connects upperclassmen mentors&mdash;third year or higher&mdash;with
      mentees, first year students at Northeastern. Throughout the
      semester, fun professional and social events will be held to foster
      strong relationships amongst the participants.

    <h3>InnoService</h3>
    <p>
      Innoservice is a product design competition that bolsters your technical
      and business skills. You will be working in a team to envision, create,
      and sell your idea to a team of panelists, engineers and business men
      alike, from P&amp;G. It is intensive but also rewarding: you will walk
      away with a sense of bitterness and accomplishment.
