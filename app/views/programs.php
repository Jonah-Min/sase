    <h3>SASE Pals</h3>
    <p>
    	Our mentoring program works a little differently than most. 
		We focus on connecting students to each other by setting 
		up a network of contacts. The SASE Pals offer underclassmen
        the chance to talk to upperclassmen who have experience with 
        school, co-op, and community involvement!<br><br>
