    <h5>History</h5>
    <p>
      The Society of Asian Scientists and Engineers (SASE) was founded in
      November 2007 to help Asian heritage scientific and engineering
      professionals achieve their full potential. Organizations existed for
      other affinity groups - The National Society of Black Engineers, the
      Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers, and the Society of Women
      Engineers â€“ and there was a need for a similar organization where
      students representing all of the pan Asian cultures could connect
      and support each other.
