          <b>The Road Not Taken: The Many Destinations of the STEM Degree</b><br>
          <i>NAAAP and SASE Pro, moderated by George Luo; SN 108</i>
          <br>75% of US News' 100 Best Jobs of 2016 are located in STEM-related fields. With such an overwhelming array of industries, professions, and careers to choose from, how can one possibly choose?
          <br>Sit down with our selection of early-to-mid career professionals from a variety of different STEM fields and have a candid conversation about what their job is like. How did they choose their job? What do they enjoy the most about where they work? And what makes them itch to leave?
          <br>We hope that not only will you carry away the right answers to your career questions, but that you will carry away the right questions to ask as you find your own path "less traveled by."

          <i>Irene Ng, Virak Ngauv; McLeod Suites (CSC 318,320,322)</i>
          <br>You probably have heard of or taken other leadership assessments, or models out there, such as the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator or Strengthsfinders. However, what makes our LSA (Leadership Self Assessment) different, is that we focus on continuous reflection and direct feedback from others to help track the growth of your leadership development. With the SASE 6E leadership model (Empower, Energize, Envision, Engage, Execute, Elastic), you can redefine and recognize the way you see leadership, as well as identify which of your leadership styles are stronger than others. Because when these 6 powers combine, they create senSASEtional leaders!

          <i>ECAASU; EL 312</i>
          <br>Innovations in STEM have introduced unprecedented changes in our world and our communities.

In this session, we will discuss the "everything else": instances where politics, economics, finance, ethics, disparities, equity, and public policy intersect with STEM. By examining case studies and the themes they exemplify, this session will bring a stronger awareness of our impacts, good and bad, as we continue to make progress in STEM.
